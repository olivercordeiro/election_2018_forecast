Here is my forecast: Republicans will retain the senate with a 52-48 majority but the Democrats will retake control of the House with a a majority of 220-215. 

The Democrats need a net two seat gain to retake the senate and I do not see that happening, rather I expect the Republicans to gain one seat and take a 52-48 lead. In the House I expect a change toward the Democrats due to distrust in President Trump's policies.
